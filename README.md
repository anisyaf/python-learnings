# Python Learnings Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my Python learning journey, including coursework from the **Google IT Automation with Python** certificate (Coursera), past experimental work, and self-study projects.

##  Mini-projects

1. Hall Effect Data Visualization

üìÇ [`01-projects/hall-effect-plot.py`](01-projects/hall-effect-plotter)

- Visualizes data from a **Hall Effect experiment on p-type Germanium**
- Uses Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `pandas` to generate:
  - Hall voltage vs magnetic field plots
  - Temperature-dependent charge carrier trends
- Replaces manual plotting with reproducible, accurate visualizations

## Fundamental Learnings 

1. Functions and Conditionals
   
üìÅ [`00-basics/functions_and_conditionals`](00-basics/functions_and_conditionals)

This script demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including:
- Defining and using functions: For multiplication (product), addition (sum), subtraction (difference), and remainder calculation (get_remainder)
- Nested function calls: To compute compound expressions
- Logical and comparison operators: To evaluate boolean expressions
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else): Including arithmetic and logical checks
- Modulus and exponentiation operations
- Basic error-checking logic: In the get_remainder() function to handle zero or equal input cases
