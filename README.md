# Python Learnings Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my Python learning journey, including coursework from the **Google IT Automation with Python** certificate (Coursera), past experimental work, and self-study projects.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `00-basics/` | Fundamentals ‚Äî variables, loops, functions, etc. |
| `01-projects/` | End-to-end mini-projects using Python|
| `02-it-automation-scripts/` | Scripts from the course |

##  Mini-projects

1. Hall Effect Data Visualization

üìÇ [`01-projects/hall-effect-plot.py`]([https://github.com/anisyaf/python-learnings/tree/main/01-projects/hall-effect-plotter])

- Visualizes data from a **Hall Effect experiment on p-type Germanium**
- Uses Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `pandas` to generate:
  - Hall voltage vs magnetic field plots
  - Temperature-dependent charge carrier trends
- Replaces manual plotting with reproducible, accurate visualizations

*More coming soon*

## Fundamental Learnings 

1. Functions and Conditionals
   
üìÅ [`00-basics/functions_and_conditionals`](00-basics/functions_and_conditionals)

This script demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including:
- Defining and using functions: For multiplication (product), addition (sum), subtraction (difference), and remainder calculation (get_remainder)
- Nested function calls: To compute compound expressions
- Logical and comparison operators: To evaluate boolean expressions
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else): Including arithmetic and logical checks
- Modulus and exponentiation operations
- Basic error-checking logic: In the get_remainder() function to handle zero or equal input cases
