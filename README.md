##  Mini-projects/Scripts

1. Hall Effect Data Visualization

ðŸ“‚ [`06-physics-scripts/hall-effect-plot.py`](./06-physics-scripts/hall-effect-plot.py)

- Visualizes data from a **Hall Effect experiment on p-type Germanium**
- Uses Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `pandas` to generate:
  - Hall voltage vs magnetic field plots
  - Temperature-dependent charge carrier trends
- Replaces manual plotting with reproducible, accurate visualizations

*More coming soon*
